      When charm is related to OpenStack through the `nova-compute` relation
      endpoint, the Neutron OVN Metadata service will be activated on the host.
      .
      Use this configuration option to control the number of workers the
      Neutron OVN Metadata service should run.
      .
      Each of the workers will establish a connection to the OVN Southbound
      database. Events the worker respond to is for example the first time
      a hypervisor hosts an instance in a subnet, so the volume should be
      relatively low. If you set this number too high you may put an
      unnecessary toll on the OVN Southbound database server.
  enable-auto-restarts:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Allow the charm and packages to restart services automatically when
      required.
